# d2l-activities

Web components to be used with activities entities!

## Developing, Testing and Contributing

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to install dependencies.

If you don't have it already, install the [Polymer CLI](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli) globally:

```shell
npm install -g polymer-cli
```

To start a [local web server](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#serve) that hosts the demo page and tests:

```shell
polymer serve
```

To lint ([eslint](http://eslint.org/) and [Polymer lint](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#lint)):

```shell
npm run lint
```

To run unit tests locally using [Polymer test](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-cli-commands#tests):

```shell
npm run test:polymer:local
```

To lint AND run local unit tests:

```shell
npm test
```

## Usage

Quick Eval should be pulled directly from `my-unassessed-activities`:

```html
<d2l-quick-eval href="https://activities.[[apiUrl]]/my-unassessed-activities" token="token"></d2l-quick-eval>
```

### Visual Differnce Testing

In order to do visual difference testing, you must generate the "golden" images first as the baseline to compare to.

To generate the golden images: `npm run test:diff:golden`.

To run the test to compare the current UI state to the stored goldens: `npm run test:diff`.

It would be ideal to generate the goldens off of the `master` branch and then run the test on your desired branch.

The golden images are stored at the following path: `\test\<component>\perceptual\screenshots\golden\`.

The currently generated test images are stored at the following path: `\test\<component>\perceptual\screenshots\current\`.

## Versioning, Releasing & Deploying

 By default, when a pull request is merged the patch version in the `package.json` will be incremented, a tag will be created, and a Github release will be created.

 Include `[increment major]`, `[increment minor]` or `[skip version]` in your merge commit message to change the default versioning behavior.
